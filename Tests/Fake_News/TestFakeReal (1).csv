0,Rubber Spider,"BETHESDA, MD�Ushering in a new, highly advanced era of creepy-crawly warfare, defense contractor Lockheed Martin announced Friday that it had developed a giant tactical rubber spider. �With the introduction of this state-of-the-art rubber spider and its highly realistic, blood-curdling fangs, the face of combat has changed forever,� said CEO James Taiclet, explaining that the long-range, 250-foot-tall precision latex arachnid could be deployed anywhere in the world to scare the living daylights out of anyone in a 3,000-mile radius. �Enemy combatants are sure to flee when they see these immense, cutting-edge rubber spiders dropped into a war zone. Its power to freak out even the most well-trained military forces in the world should not be overstated.� Reached for comment, U.N. official confirmed they had drafted a resolution condemning the use of giant rubber spiders in war zones as inhumane and gross.",FAKE
1,Vatican,"VATICAN CITY�Revealing that he had quickly distinguished himself at the four-day invitation-only event, Vatican sources confirmed Friday that Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, a 75-year-old American prelate with a 3-foot vertical leap, had emerged as the frontrunner in the Papal Combine. �The College of Cardinals has produced some strong prospects this time around, but Dolan�s basilica agility time of 10.8 seconds has made this his papacy to lose,� said Catholicism analyst Dave Hutchins, adding that high-ranking members of the Holy See hadn�t seen vertical prowess like Dolan�s since the legendary John Paul II era. �These cardinals have been training their whole lives for this, but when the whistle blows for the 40-yard baptism dash, Dolan�s leaving them all in the dust. That 3-foot vertical is putting him way closer to God than any of the other pontifex maximus hopefuls. Every drill they run, Dolan�s at the front of the pack. He�s swinging that censer the fastest. He�s weaving through those cones and glasses of sacramental wine without spilling a drop of holy water. This is a cardinal in his physical and spiritual prime, and frankly, it�s an exciting time to be Catholic.� At press time, Cardinal Dolan had reportedly dropped out of the combine after a blood test came back positive for Protestantism.",FAKE
2,Robotics,"Google DeepMind is launching two new AI models designed to help robots �perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before.� The first, called Gemini Robotics, is a vision-language-action model capable of understanding new situations, even if it hasn�t been trained on them.

Gemini Robotics is built on Gemini 2.0, the latest version of Google�s flagship AI model. During a press briefing, Carolina Parada, the senior director and head of robotics at Google DeepMind, said Gemini Robotics �draws from Gemini�s multimodal world understanding and transfers it to the real world by adding physical actions as a new modality.�

The new model makes advancements in three key areas that Google DeepMind says are essential to building helpful robots: generality, interactivity, and dexterity. In addition to the ability to generalize new scenarios, Gemini Robotics is better at interacting with people and their environment. It�s also capable of performing more precise physical tasks, such as folding a piece of paper or removing a bottle cap.

�While we have made progress in each one of these areas individually in the past with general robotics, we�re bringing [drastically] increasing performance in all three areas with a single model,� Parada said. �This enables us to build robots that are more capable, that are more responsive and that are more robust to changes in their environment.�

Google DeepMind is also launching Gemini Robotics-ER (or embodied reasoning), which the company describes as an advanced visual language model that can �understand our complex and dynamic world.�

As Parada explains, when you�re packing a lunchbox and have items on a table in front of you, you�d need to know where everything is, as well as how to open the lunchbox, how to grasp the items, and where to place them. That�s the kind of reasoning Gemini Robotics-ER is expected to do. It�s designed for roboticists to connect with existing low-level controllers � the system that controls a robot�s movements � allowing them to enable new capabilities powered by Gemini Robotics-ER.

In terms of safety, Google DeepMind researcher Vikas Sindhwani told reporters that the company is developing a �layered-approach,� adding that Gemini Robotics-ER models �are trained to evaluate whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given scenario.� The company is also releasing new benchmarks and frameworks to help further safety research in the AI industry. Last year, Google DeepMind introduced its �Robot Constitution,� a set of Isaac Asimov-inspired rules for its robots to follow.",REAL
3,Restaurant,"The North End is welcoming back a familiar name in Italian dining � chef Tony Susi, known for his expertise in pasta-making, is opening Little Sage at 352 Hanover Street. The restaurant, which officially opens to the public on March 12th, marks a reunion between Susi and restaurateur Jennifer Matarazzo, his business partner from the original Sage restaurant.

Sage first opened in the late 1990s and quickly became a favorite among Boston diners for its refined yet soulful approach to Italian food. Susi, who started out as the executive chef under Matarazzo, later purchased the restaurant and continued its legacy in the North End before opening a location in the South End. Since then, Susi has honed his craft in some of the area�s top kitchens, including Capo, Ripasso at Wink & Nod, Geppetto and most recently, Bar Enza in Cambridge.

Now, nearly 30 years later, Susi and Matarazzo will be reviving the concept with a fresh perspective while maintaining the essence that made Sage so special. Little Sage will occupy the former Locale space, which was operated by Matarazzo until earlier this month. While the new restaurant will introduce modern elements, longtime fans can expect to see nods to the past, including some of Susi�s signature dishes like handmade gnocchi and fazzoletti. The menu will also include oven-roasted dishes fresh from the existing pizza oven, along with entrees like littleneck clams with lemon and garlic butter, Giannone chicken with crushed potatoes and brown butter sage, and jumbo shrimp with roasted leeks and capers. A small sfizi menu will be available at the bar, complementing a curated selection of beer, wine and cordials. Meanwhile, the popular pizza program from Locale will continue as a separate �Locale To Go� operation for pickup and delivery orders.

Little Sage will be open for dinner daily from 4:00-10:00pm and for lunch on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays starting at noon. Hop over to the restaurant website or follow along on social (here for Little Sage or here for Locale) for updates and more info or just go on and book your table online here to be among the first to say welcome back.

4,Falcon9,"WASHINGTON � A Falcon 9 launched a pair of NASA science missions March 11 that will explore the infrared universe and study the solar wind.

The SpaceX Falcon 9 lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 11:10 p.m. Eastern. It placed into sun-synchronous orbits the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) spacecraft and the four satellites of the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission. All five spacecraft were in contact with controllers and functioning as expected after launch, the agency stated.

NASA elected to launch SPHEREx and PUNCH together, using the excess capacity in the Falcon 9 originally procured for SPHEREx since both missions were going to similar orbits. It is part of an approach by NASA to take advantage of rideshare launch opportunities.

�This is a real change in how we do business,� Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator for science at NASA, said at a March 7 prelaunch briefing. �We can maximize the efficiency of launches by two payloads at once.�

�We at SpaceX are big fans of rideshare,� said Julianna Scheiman, director of NASA science missions at SpaceX. While the company has flown many commercial rideshare missions, this was the first for NASA�s Launch Services Program. Two more NASA rideshare launches are planned for later this year by SpaceX, of the IMAP and TRACERS heliophysics missions, she noted.

The launch of SPHEREx and PUNCH was delayed by nearly two weeks, primarily because of launch processing issues. �We had a series of integration issues that came up,� Scheiman said. That included problems with equipment called an impedance mismatch assembly to mitigate launch environments that required new fasteners. That contributed to a �larger portion� of the delay, she said.

When the spacecraft were encapsulated in the payload fairing, technicians found a leak in the pneumatic system that separates the fairing in flight. That required removing the payload fairing to repair the leak before reinstalling it. Weather also delayed transport of the encapsulated payload from the payload processing facility to the launch pad.

Another issue, she said, was a �high-priority range operation� that required SpaceX to pause launch preparations. That is an apparent reference to the X-37B spaceplane that landed at Vandenberg early March 7.

There were additional delays after that pre-launch briefing. NASA and SpaceX called off a March 8 launch attempt because of an unspecified issue with the Falcon 9, while a March 10 attempt was scrubbed less than an hour before liftoff due to poor weather and a �ground data-flow issue� with SPHEREx.",REAL
