Boston Celtics
The Boston Celtics (/ˈsɛltɪks/ SEL-tiks[a]) are an
American professional basketball team based in
Boston. The Celtics compete in the National
Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the
Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference.
Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight
teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD
Garden, a shared arena with the NHL's Boston
Bruins. The Celtics are commonly regarded as the
most successful team in NBA history and hold the
records for most NBA championships won, with 18,
and most recorded wins of any NBA
franchise.[12][13]
The Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late
1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach,
acquired Bill Russell in 1956, later becoming the
cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell,
Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn, the Celtics won their
first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with
a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers
including Heinsohn, Don Nelson, K. C. Jones, John
Havlicek, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill
Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest
period in franchise history, winning eight
consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966.
After Russell became the team's player-coach, as
well as the first African American head coach in any
United States sport, they won back-to-back titles in
1968 and 1969. The Celtics entered a period of
rebuilding after Russell retired in 1969.
In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders
once again, winning championships in 1974 and
1976 under the leadership of head coach Tom
Heinsohn with Dave Cowens, Havlicek, and Jo Jo
White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to
dominance. Anchored by the "Big Three" of Larry
Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the team
experienced a renewed rivalry with the "Showtime"
Lakers and won championships in 1981, 1984, and

these first round picks, the team drafted Jaylen
Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2016 and 2017,

Statement

The "Celtics" nickname and the team's mascot
"Lucky the Leprechaun" are nods to Boston's
historically large Irish population, and also to the
Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that
played in the early 20th century.[14] The Celtics have
a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who
City
Classic
are second in NBA history with 17 championships.
The teams' rivalry was especially pronounced in the
1960s and 1980s. The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals and have
defeated them nine times. 41 members of Basketball Hall of Fame have played for the Celtics at least
once in their careers. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have
won the NBA Most Valuable Player award; overall, Celtics players have won an NBA-record 10 MVP
awards.[15]

History
1946–1950: Early years
The Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter
A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff
appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4–1. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the
Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association
following the merger of the BAA and rival National Basketball League.[16][17] In 1950, the Celtics signed
Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.[18] Chuck Connors of The
Rifleman fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.[19]

1950–1958: Arrival of Bob Cousy and Red Auerbach
The Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of
coach Red Auerbach.[20] In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had
no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting—both of
opposing teams and college draft prospects—and scheduled all road
trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy,
whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross
because he was "too flashy".[21] Cousy's contract eventually became
the property of the Chicago Stags,[22] but when that franchise went
bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft.
Bob Cousy played 13 years for
After the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending
the team, 6 of them ending in
perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with
NBA titles
the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the
draft.[23] After negotiating with the Rochester Royals—a negotiation
that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to
Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No. 2—Auerbach used the pick to select University of
San Francisco center Bill Russell.[24] Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA
Rookie of the Year, Tom Heinsohn.[25] Both Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with
Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more
than a decade.[25] With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St.
Louis Hawks in seven games, earning their first NBA title.[26] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the
NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[27]

1958–1969: Decade-long dynasty
Following the acquisition of K.C. Jones in 1958, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more
than a decade.[28] In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis
Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships.[29] During that time, the Celtics met the
Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In
1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On
December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C.

Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the
starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis
97–84. Boston won its next 11 games with
Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.[30] The
Celtics of the late 1950s–1960s are widely
considered one of the most dominant teams of
all time.[31]
Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66
season and Russell took over as player-coach,
which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell

NBA title teams in 13 years
the Celtics (1957–1969)
became the first African-American coach in
as a Celtic
winning 10 titles
any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the
general manager, a position he would hold well
into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers
in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and
1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time.[33] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively
ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[34] The team's run of
8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history,[35] with Russell's 11
titles being the most won by an NBA player.

1969–1978: Rebuilding and further success
The 1969–70 season was a rebuilding year, as
the Celtics had their first losing record since the
1949–50 season. However, with the acquisition
of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave
Cowens[36] and Jo Jo White,[37] the Celtics
soon became dominant again. After losing in
the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the
Celtics regrouped and came out determined in
1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular
season record. But the season ended in
disappointment, as they were upset in seven
games by the New York Knicks in the
John Havlicek, 16 years
Dave Cowens, two titles and
Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his
with the Celtics
MVP in 1973
right shoulder in game six and was forced to
play game seven shooting left-handed.[38] The
Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for
their 12th NBA championship.[39] Boston took a 3–2 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on
their home court. The Bucks won Game Six in Boston when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot
with 3 seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. Cowens was the
hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five
years.

In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals
featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns
trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard
turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics
prevailed.[40] After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another
rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named
Cedric Maxwell.[41] "Cornbread" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed
promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977–78 season in which they went 32–50 as
Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[42]
The Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft.[43] Auerbach took a risk by selecting
junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the sixth overall pick, knowing that Bird would stay in college for
his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait. The team retained Bird's
rights for one year and signed him soon after he led Indiana State to the NCAA championship game. In
1978, Celtics owner Irv Levin traded franchises with Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown Jr.[44] Two
weeks before the swap of franchises was made official, details of a six-player trade between the two
teams were reported. Boston sent Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington to the
Braves for "Tiny" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes.[45] The move turned Boston fans against
Brown, both because Kunnert and Washington were seen as key pieces of the team's future and because
Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade.[45]

1979–1992: Larry Bird era
The relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown's decision to acquire Bob McAdoo
in February 1979,[46] in exchange for three first-round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to
rebuild the franchise.[47] Again, Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach.[48] Auerbach almost
left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result.[47] With public support strongly behind
Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in 1979 rather than run the risk of losing his famed
general manager.[49][50] The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53.[51] Newcomers
Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.[52]
Larry Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season.[53] With a new owner in place, Auerbach
made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded
McAdoo,[54] a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive
specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft.[50] He also picked up point guard Gerald
Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt,
blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA
Rookie of the Year honors[55] the team went 61–21, a 32-game improvement from the previous season.
Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference
Finals.[56]
After the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of
future Hall of Famers for a pair of first-round draft picks. Seeking to improve the team immediately,
Auerbach sent the team's two first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert
Parish[57] and the Warriors' first-round pick. He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State

to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale.[58]
The "Big Three" of Bird, McHale and Parish played together for the
Celtics until 1992, won three NBA championships together,[59] and
were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all
time.[60][61][62][63]
Despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training
camp, the Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81.[64]
Once again, the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference
Finals, falling behind 3–1 before coming back to win Game Seven,
91–90. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA championship over
the Houston Rockets,[65] with Maxwell being named NBA Finals
MVP.[66]
Following the 1981–82 season, the Celtics once again met the 76ers
in the playoffs. This time, they lost in seven games.[67] In 1983 the
Celtics were swept in the playoffs (a first for the franchise) by the
Milwaukee Bucks;[68] afterwards, Fitch resigned and the team was
sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.[69]

12 time All-Star Larry Bird played
in the Celtics from 1979 to 1992.
He is widely regarded as one of
the greatest basketball players
of all time.

In 1983–84, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62–20
and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus.[70] Boston came
back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th
championship.[71] Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star
Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially
retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team
president.[72] He was succeeded by Jan Volk.[72]
In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the Finals, with the Lakers
winning.[73] This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics
in the Finals and the only time the team had won a championship at
Robert Parish
Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired
Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric
Maxwell.[74] Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading
the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since.
Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics'
success in 1986.
The Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft and drafted University of Maryland star Len
Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era.[75] Bias died 36 hours later of an accidental cocaine
overdose.[76] Despite the tragedy, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again
winning the Eastern Conference Championship.[77] They were defeated in the Finals by the Lakers in six
games.
In 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.[78]
Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers.
Boston's hopes for 1988–89 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet
early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons.

Bird returned in 1989–90 and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after
winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight
games and the series. After the playoffs, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former
Celtics player Chris Ford.
Under Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the Atlantic Division title
even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the
playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51–31 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and
repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics
lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited
Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and
a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire
in 1992.

1993–1998: Tragedy and decline
The loss of Bird and the aging of the team's other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding
mode.[79] Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston's Northeastern
University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston's four-game series loss by
the Charlotte Hornets.[80] An examination revealed heart problems,[81] but Lewis was able to get doctors
to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at
Brandeis University during the off-season.[82] The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number
35.[83] With McHale having retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston's original Big 3
era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish's signing with Charlotte.[57] The team collapsed, finishing
out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark.
In 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team's
new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected
University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston's first-round pick in the 1994 NBA draft.
Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded.
1994–95 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins
as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Rađa, a power
forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993–94. The Celtics
made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in four games. In 1995, the Celtics
moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired
Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the
Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record.
Things got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise-record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA
record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite
of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker, Carr resigned after the season ended, while
Rick Pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and
head coach, reportedly on a $70 million ten-year contract. Volk resigned on May 7, 1997.[84][85] Pitino's
appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for
more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino
was not the savior everyone hoped he would be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with
dignity, even as the team failed to improve.

The Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft,[86] and used the picks to select
a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games
the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Rađa and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams
traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics
in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a
promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night,[87] and hard
play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories
from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks.[88][89] Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during
his rookie year,[90] and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.[91]

1998–2013: Paul Pierce era
The following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul
Pierce,[92] a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier
than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during
the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, averaging 19.5 points and being
named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals.[93]
However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve
meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1,
2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable
"walking through that door" speech, invoking Bird, McHale and Parish,
which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for
organizations wrestling with bygone glory.[94] He resigned in January
2001.[95]
Drafted by the Celtics in
1998, Paul Pierce went on
to star for the Celtics and
later won the NBA Finals
MVP Award when the team
won the NBA championship
in 2008

Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest
improvement under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA
star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players
acquired over the years. While the team was 12–21 when Pitino left,
O'Brien's record to finish the season was 24–24.[96] Following the 2000–
01 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis.
As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001
NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown.
Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics.
The Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of
2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey
Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip
to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3–2.
Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the
Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4–1. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since
1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2–1 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the
fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4–2.[97]

2003–2007: New ownership and arrival of Doc Rivers
In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C.,[98] led by H.
Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but
were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime.[99] Before their
elimination, the team hired former Celtics' guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace
to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent
Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk).[100] In return, the Celtics received the
often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch,[101] and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics
made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all four games.[102]
The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the
2004–05 season,[103] having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West
and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good
young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a
group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic
Division title since 1991–92, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine
Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again,
with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the
Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the
Miami Heat. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged careerhighs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record,
owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the
likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for
underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former allstar Wally Szczerbiak.

Head coach Doc Rivers
led the Celtics to an
NBA title in 2008.

The Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon
Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team's revival. In the second round the Celtics added center
Leon Powe.[104] The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red
Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its
inception in 1946.[105] The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007
after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a
much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt
after the whistle.[106] The Celtics compiled a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a
franchise-record 18-game losing streak.[107] At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst
record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg
Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery.
2007–2012: Pierce, Allen, and Garnett "Big Three" era
In the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to
prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to
Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick, which the team used to select
LSU's Glen "Big Baby" Davis.[108] The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson,
Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar
power forward Kevin Garnett.[109] These moves created a new "Big Three" of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett.

Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen were key players in the Celtics' 2008 NBA title victory

In the 2007–08 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team
went 66–16 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006–07 record. However, the team
struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first
round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then
beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.[110]
For the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off
in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98–88, fueled by strong play by Garnett and
Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108–102 despite nearly
blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled
Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87–81. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point
deficit in Game 4 to win 97–91, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again
blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103–98, sending the series back to Boston. In
Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul
Pierce was named Finals MVP.[111] With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever
played in a postseason with 26.[112]
The 2008–09 Celtics started off the season at 27–2, the then-best starting record in NBA history.[113]
They also had a franchise-record 19-game streak.[114] After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured
in a loss against the Utah Jazz and missed the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved
for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against
the Magic in the second round.[115]
In 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis
Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However,
Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the
Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season
with a 50–32 record.[116] Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to
make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play.[117] For the 12th time, the
Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the
Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a
severe knee injury early in Game Six,[118] and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games.

During the 2010 off-season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two
former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal. Shaquille O'Neal's presence wound up
leading to Perkins' departure: the Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to
injury[119] and had a 19–3 record in games when O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[120] Consequently,
Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41–14 and led the
Eastern Conference despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win
only 15 of their final 27 games. They finished with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed.[119][121] The
2010–11 season still provided three landmarks: The Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000
victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points (the others are Larry Bird and John
Havlicek), and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most career three-pointers. The 2011 NBA playoffs
started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round. In the second round,
they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille
O'Neal, limited to 12 minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.[122]
The Celtics started the lockout-shortened season 0–3, as Pierce was out with a heel injury. At the All-Star
break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams in
the league after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their fifth division title in a row.
The Celtics made the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Celtics
faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and
Garnett. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics defeated the 76ers in seven games. The Celtics faced the
Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in seven games to the eventual NBA champions.
The 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett
was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics
offered; this move brought the five-year "Big Three" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics
finished the season with 41 wins.[123] The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3–0 in the first round of
the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a
comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to four.[124]

2013–2016: Rebuilding years
During the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed to terminate his contract. He departed the
Celtics to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Celtics received a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as
compensation. A few days later, Pierce, Garnett (who waived a no-trade clause), Jason Terry, and D. J.
White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris
Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the
right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn.[125] The deal marked the start of a youth movement
for the team.[126]
On July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would
replace Doc Rivers as head coach.[127] Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his
return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement
by acquiring two draft picks in a three-team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the
Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013–14 season
marked the Celtics' first missed playoffs since the "Big Three".[128]

The next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th
overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014
NBA draft,[129] and signed Evan Turner. The 2014–15 season had
several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie
Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan
Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and
future picks.[130] A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics,[131]
leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left
metatarsal stress fracture,[132] and the team was only tenth in the East
with 28 games remaining.[133] However, midseason acquisition Isaiah
Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the
season with a 40–42 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern
Conference Playoffs.[134] The Celtics were swept by the second seeded
Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round.

Brad Stevens, former head
coach of the Celtics.

In the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton
with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed
forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward
David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015–16 NBA season with a 48–34 record, earning the fifth seed in
the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs.
After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a
hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4–2 to the
Hawks, ending their season.

2016–present: Brown–Tatum era ("the Jays")
In the 2016 NBA draft, the Celtics selected
Jaylen Brown with the third pick. On July 8,
2016, the team signed four-time All-Star Al
Horford.[135] The Celtics finished the 2016–17
season with a 53–29 record and clinched the
top seed in the Eastern Conference.[136] After a
hip injury ended Thomas' playoff run in game 2
of the Eastern Conference Finals,[137] the
Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five
games. Isaiah Thomas was selected for his
second straight All-Star game and first AllNBA selection, finishing third in the league in
scoring and fifth in MVP voting. For the 2017
NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery,
Jaylen Brown
Jayson Tatum
[b]
earning them the first pick.
They were
projected to select freshman guard Markelle
Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the
2017 draft and future picks.[138] The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third
pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. During the off-season, the team signed Gordon

Hayward.[139] On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder,
Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for
Kyrie Irving.[140]
2017-2019: Kyrie Irving saga
By the end of the off-season, only four Celtics' players remained from the 2016–17 team,[141] with
Marcus Smart being the longest-tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team's opening night
game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in
his left leg,[142] causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season.[143] Despite the loss, the
Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in
the teams' history.[144] The Celtics finished the year with a 55–27 record, good enough for second place
in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round in seven
games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five
games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals.
The Celtics finished the 2018–19 season with a 49–33 record.
Analysts started questioning the team's performance and chances
for the championship when the Celtics had a 10–10 record after
the first 20 games on November 24, 2018.[145] The Celtics then
won the next eight games improving their record to 18–10.[146]
During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the
Cleveland Cavaliers 128–95, the New York Knicks 128–100, and
also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133–77), setting a
record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history,
while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away
team.[147] The Celtics finished the regular season in fourth place
in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game, Marcus Smart
injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season
and the first round of the playoffs.[148] In the 2019 playoffs, the
Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to
the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.[149][150]
The Celtics held four picks in the 2019 NBA draft. Following a
Kyrie Irving played for Boston for
series of transactions, the team landed Romeo Langford with the
two seasons making two all star
14th pick and also added Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and
appearances.
[151]
Tremont Waters (2020 G-league Rookie of the year).
During
the 2019 off-season, Irving and Horford signed with the Brooklyn
Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively. Irving left, despite promising to stay in Boston.[152] On June
30, 2019, the Celtics and point guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four-year maximum contract worth $141
million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte
Hornets; the Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second-round draft pick to Charlotte in
exchange for Walker and a 2020 second-round draft pick.[153] On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a
two-year contract with center Enes Kanter.[154]

2019-2021: Rise of "the Jays"
Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Celtics were one of the 22 teams invited to the
NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[155] In the 2020 playoffs, the Celtics
swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, beat the Toronto Raptors in a seven-game series, and fell
to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games.[156] Boston struggled with injuries in
the 2020–21 season, with Walker, Tatum and Brown all missing games at different points in the season
due to injury and COVID-19. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the
play-in tournament, where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119–100. In the playoffs, they lost to
the Brooklyn Nets in five games.[157]
2021-22: First Finals appearance for the Jays
On June 2, 2021, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens as president of basketball operations
replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[158] On June 18, Stevens made his first
transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and a
2025 second-round pick in exchange for former Celtic Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round
pick.[159] On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his
own replacement as head coach of the Celtics.[160][161] Tatum made his third All-Star appearance off the
bench at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland.
In April 2022, the Celtics qualified for the 2022 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern
Conference, having a 51–31 record; they swept the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the
postseason.[162] They next faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the
Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating both teams in seven-game series, earning the
Celtics their first Finals appearance since 2010. The Celtics took a 2–1 series lead, but lost the next three
games to lose to the Golden State Warriors 4–2.[163]
2022-23: Conference finals loss
In September, the Celtics suspended Udoka for the whole 2022–23 season for engaging in an improper
intimate relationship with a female staffer.[164] Assistant coach Joe Mazzulla replaced Udoka as the
interim head coach.[165] On February 16, 2023, Mazzulla was named the team's permanent head coach
after leading the Celtics to a league-best 42–17 record at the NBA All-Star break.[166] After overcoming a
3–2 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics fell
behind 3–0 in a rematch against the Heat. They battled their way back to Game 7 thanks to a Derrick
White buzzer-beater in Game 6, but the Heat ultimately prevented the first 3–0 comeback in NBA history
with a decisive win in Boston.
2023-24: 18th championship for Boston
During the 2023 off-season, the Celtics acquired Kristaps Porziņģis from the Wizards. In the trade, they
sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal,[167] and also traded Grant Williams to
the Dallas Mavericks.[168] On October 1, 2023, the Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in exchange for
Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III and two draft picks.[169] On February 7, 2024, before the trade
deadline, the Celtics acquired Xavier Tillman from the Grizzlies.[170]

The Celtics finished the 2023–24 regular season with the best
record in the NBA, securing a 64–18 record.[171] After the regular
season's close, the Celtics entered the 2024 NBA playoffs,
defeating the Miami Heat in the first round, moving on to defeat
the Cleveland Cavaliers in the East Semifinals, and moving on
again to defeat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference
Finals.[172][173][174] The Celtics' victory in the Eastern Conference
Finals on May 27, 2024, was accompanied by the announcement
that Jaylen Brown had been selected as the NBA Eastern
Conference Finals MVP, and Brown was presented with the Larry
Bird trophy, the first of his career.[175][176] The Celtics would go
on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the NBA
Finals, their record-setting 18th championship and breaking the tie
with the Lakers (who have 17).[177]

Rivalries

Al Horford made an All-Star
Appearance for Boston in 2018 and
won his first championship in 2024.

Los Angeles Lakers
The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises
in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry.[178] The two teams have met a record twelve
times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate
the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s,
in 2008, and in 2010.
The Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four.
The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early
1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since
1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals
which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are first and second for the highest number of
championships, with the Celtics leading the Lakers, 18 titles to 17; together, their 35 championships
account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history.

Atlanta Hawks
The Celtics–Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association
that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949–50
season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League
and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly
competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at
Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the
NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four
NBA Finals.[179] While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA
Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified
in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics.

Brooklyn Nets
The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective
locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the
Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to
heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics[180]
who claimed Martin was a "fake" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court
tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of "Wife
Beater!"[181] in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being
traded, Kenyon Martin stated, "Our fans hate them, their fans hate us." Bill Walton said at the time that
Nets-Celtics was the "beginning of the next great NBA rivalry" during the Eastern Conference Finals in
2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the
2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were
indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28,
resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for
two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.[182] The story was revisited on
December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and
players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by
the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange
for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division
teams.[183]

Detroit Pistons
The rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as
Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe
Dumars. These teams met in the NBA playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the
Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals
appearances in 1988 and their championship seasons of 1989 and 1990. Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin
Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games
to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.[184]

New York Knicks
The rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of
which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York
teams, most notably the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Boston
and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the
duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular
season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the
playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.[185]

Philadelphia 76ers
The Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA
playoffs, playing each other in 22 series, of which the Celtics have won 15.[186] The 76ers are considered
the Celtics' biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell

and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to
1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA
Finals series in the 1960s when the 76ers won in 1967.[187]

Washington Wizards
One of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created
between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both
teams had engaged in a fight in 1984,[188] the rivalry intensified
during the 2015–16 season in a January regular season game after Jae
Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange
words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate
that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It
was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics
Wilt Chamberlain of the
beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign
Philadelphia 76ers being
with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016–
defended by Celtics' center Bill
17 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were
Russell in 1966
up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul
and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began
to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet
him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next
meeting, the Celtics won 117–108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front
of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight
back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but
the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on
guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling
the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied "If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team."[189]
In their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is
similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123–108. The two
teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff
Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss
the rest of the game which was a 123–111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In
Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats.[190] In Game
3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to
drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a
flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4.[191] No significant altercations
erupted in the rest of the seven-game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since
dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they
played on Christmas in 2017.

Miami Heat
The Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat developed an intense rivalry during the 2010s. The two teams
were highlighted by their star trios in Boston's Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce whereas Miami
had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They first met in the 2010 NBA Playoffs where
Boston won the series in 5 games. They would then meet the following year where Miami would end up

winning in 5 games. The teams would meet for the third straight year in the 2012 Eastern Conference
Finals. Despite Boston holding a 3–2 lead, Miami would win the next 2 games to advance to the NBA
Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Miami Heat and
Boston Celtics met in the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals where Miami won in 6 games and advanced to
the NBA Finals where they were prevented Boston from meeting their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers.
Unfortunately, Miami lost in 6 games to the Los Angeles Lakers. They would meet in the 2022 Eastern
Conference Finals where Boston finally beat the Miami Heat in 7 games. It was their first win against
Miami since 2010. In the following year, the two met in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite
Miami taking a commanding a 3–0 lead, Boston won the next three games to send the series to 7 games.
However, Miami won to avoid earning the distinction of blowing a 3–0 lead. They then met in the 2024
first round where Boston beat Miami in 5 games.

Records, retired numbers, and awards
The Celtics have won an NBA-record 18 championships.[192]
Forty-eight members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of
Fame are connected to the Celtics,[193] and the franchise has
retired 23 jersey numbers, more than any other American sports

Retained draft rights
The Celtics hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the
NBA. A drafted player is ostensibly either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed
by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains
the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team
ends.[197] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.

Coaches
Head coaches
There have been 18 head coaches in Celtics' history. Red Auerbach is the most successful franchise's head
coach having won 9 NBA championships with the team. Celtics' legend Bill Russell took coaching duties
from Auerbach and led them to 2 NBA championships while playing and coaching at the same time. The
other two coaches that won 2 NBA titles with the team are Tom Heinsohn and K. C. Jones. Bill Fitch and
Doc Rivers led the Celtics to 1 NBA championship apiece, as has current head coach Joe Mazzulla.[219]

Logos and uniforms
Logos
The Boston Celtics logo features a
leprechaun spinning a basketball, named
Lucky, originally depicted with a large
basketball for a background. It was
The Celtics' wordmark,
originally designed by Zang Auerbach,
used since the 1969–70
the brother of Celtics head coach Red
season
Auerbach.[220] Through the 1995–96
season, the logo's only colors were
[221]
green, white and black.
Then for the 1996–97 season,
celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color
treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold
was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the
ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.[222]

Red Auerbach coached the
Boston Celtics to 9 NBA titles,
with eight straight between 1959
and 1966.

The Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the
letters "Celtics" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998–99 season. The
alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For
much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new
secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.[5][223]

Uniforms
Primary uniforms

The Celtics uniforms, as worn by Bill Sharman, Dennis Johnson, Rajon Rondo and Semi Ojeleye, have seen
minimal changes since the 1950s.

For much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The
basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms was formalized in the team's early years, and along the
way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.[224]
Among the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block
lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in
1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city
name (1950s–1965; 2014–present) or the team name (1965–2014).[225]
When Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the "home" and
"away" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the "Association"
uniforms while the green uniforms became the "Icon" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of
home and road games.[4]

In January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the
"exclusive Data and Analytics partner" for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics
more than $7 million per year[226] to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left
shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game
uniforms.[227][228] Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the
Celtics' uniforms.
In November 2020, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with Vistaprint who became the main jersey
sponsor of the team.[229] In July 2024, Amica Mutual Insurance signed on as the team's jersey sponsor.[7]
Alternate uniforms

"Parquet Pride" uniform in 2017.

From 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the
word "Boston" on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms was the black panels
with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s.[230]
A gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed "Parquet Pride", the uniforms featured
sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas' NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted
leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the
sides.[231]
For 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black "Statement" uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to
the league's third jerseys). The uniform features a black base with "Celtics" in green lettering and white
trim, and other than a few changes in the striping scheme, the uniform remained essentially the same.
Starting in 2020, the "Statement" uniform would feature the Air Jordan brand logo, a feature previously
exclusive to the Charlotte Hornets uniforms.[232]
Special uniforms
Between 2006 and 2017, the Celtics wore special St. Patrick's Day uniforms. The initial uniforms were
worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white
trim and the city name in front.[233] For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city

name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates.[234] In 2016 and
2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous
striping.
During the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys
in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words "Boston" on the front side of
the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white
and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a
patch containing the Union Jack.
At the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of
their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team.
The Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008–09 season. For the
first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake.
Then in the 2012–13 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For
the 2016–17 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but
without the additional striping.
Starting with the 2017–18 season, the Celtics wore special edition "City" uniforms designed by Nike.
Their first "City" uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green
shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach's signature near the
uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.[235]
For the 2018–19 season, the Celtics wore white "City" uniforms with green letters and shamrocks
trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate
Celtics logo on the beltline.[236][237] In addition, the Celtics wore an "Earned" edition uniform exclusive
only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the "City"
uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim. Both uniforms were inspired
by the team's warmup jackets they wore from the 1950s until 1998, which contained a brighter gold
trim.[238]
The Celtics' "City" uniform for the 2019–20 season featured a green base and a stylized "Boston"
wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the
beltline.[239]
The 2020–21 Celtics' "City" uniform was patterned after the 17 championship banners that adorn the TD
Garden rafters. The uniform, which is white with thick green stripes, features the full name in Futura
Condensed stacked in front, and Red Auerbach's signature and quote "The Boston Celtics are not a
basketball team. They're a way of life." appears above the manufacturer's tag.[240] The Celtics also
released a second "Earned" uniform after qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs; this design features a dark
green base with Celtic and lime green striping, and the letters were rendered in Celtic green with white
trim.[241]
The Celtics' green "City" uniform for the 2021–22 season was a mix of previous uniform designs. The
neck and arm striping was taken from their current uniforms. The green lettering with white drop
shadows was a nod to the 1949 uniform design. The gray triangles on the shorts represented the
franchise's initial uniforms; the left side contained the team's 75th anniversary emblem, while the right

side contained a green-and-white version of the Red Auerbach memorial shamrock used in the 2006–07
season. Contrasting nameplates on the back were inspired by the warmup jackets the team used for much
of its history, and the original "jumping leprechaun" logo from the 1960s was added to the waist. Retired
numbers, the Auerbach signature and quotation (see 2021 "City" uniform), and 17 shamrocks
representing each championship season, surrounded the jock tag.[242]
The 2022–23 "City" uniform served as a memorial to Bill Russell, who died on July 31. The uniform is
dark green with metallic gold and black accents, and has the "Celtics" wordmark inspired by the Slade's
Bar & Grill restaurant once owned by Russell. The black stripes contained 11 gold diamonds on each
side, commemorating each of Russell's championships, and also featured a grayscale pattern of the
parquet floor. The waistband contained Russell's jersey no. 6 surrounded by the 11 gold diamonds.[243]
The "City" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a nod to the origins of the game of basketball. The
white-based design featured dark green letters and brown trim in reference to traditional maker's marks
from Boston's history of furniture makers, along with wood grain accents to reference the peach baskets
first used in the game.[244] In another first, the Celtics unveiled an alternate court specific to the 2023
NBA in-season tournament. The design, which is based on the "City" uniform, featured a mostly greenpainted maple court with a brown strip along the free throw lanes. The silhouette of the NBA Cup is
situated along the free throw lanes, and the actual trophy is painted at center court along with the
"BOSTON" wordmark.[245]
For the 2024–25 "City" uniform, the Celtics built upon last season's "City" uniform and focused on
continuous evolution of the game of basketball. The black-based uniform featured "Action green" (neon
green) letters and striping, along with futuristic-style numbers.[246]
Memorial patches
During the 2006–07 season, the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the
nickname "Red" in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach, who died
shortly prior to the beginning of the season.[247]
The team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the
left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured thirteen times to date: Walter Brown (1964–65), Bob
Schmertz (1975–76), Joan Cohen (1989–90), Johnny Most (1992–93), Reggie Lewis (1993–94), Dorothy
Auerbach (2000–01), Dennis Johnson (2006–07),[247] Jim Loscutoff (2015–16), Jo Jo White (2017–18),
John Havlicek (2018–19), Tom Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones (both 2020–21), Sam Jones (2021–22), and
Bill Walton (2023–24). During the 2019–20 season, the Celtics wore a black band in honor of two people
who had never been part of the Celtics organization; former NBA commissioner David Stern and former
Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The Celtics have also worn a black band for reasons not directly
related to the franchise, such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 (later replaced with a dedicated
memorial patch), and the death of Isaiah Thomas' younger sister during the 2017 NBA playoffs.[248]
In the 2022–23 season, the Celtics joined the rest of the NBA in wearing the black no. 6 patch in memory
of Bill Russell.[249]

Uniform traditions
The team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history. According to
legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white
sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. In the early 1970s,
the Celtics changed their sneaker color to green, but by 1985, returned to the customary black due to the
difficulty of producing the right shade of Celtic green.[250]
Prior to the 2003–04 season, then-Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce
suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers.
Ainge gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the
black sneakers on away games, and brought them back for all home games during the 2004 NBA
playoffs, and in one home game during the 2005 NBA playoffs. In the 2008–09 season, they wore white
sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most
recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold
accents.[251] Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics
players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although
for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers.
The Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the
1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually
declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the
practice after the 2011–12 season in favor of a templated jacket design common to all 30 teams.

Television and radio
NBC Sports Boston is the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981 when
the station was known as PRISM New England. In 1983, it rebranded as SportsChannel New England.
Like all the other SportsChannel networks, the New England channel was rebranded as Fox Sports New
England when former owner Cablevision entered into a partnership with Liberty Media and News
Corporation in 1998. Comcast purchased Cablevision's original network stake in 2001, then acquired the
remaining stake in what was now FSN New England in 2007 and rebranded the network as Comcast
SportsNet New England. In 2017, all CSN networks (including CSN New England) were renamed as
NBC Sports Regional Networks in reference to Comcast's current ownership of NBCUniversal.
As of the 2024–25 season, Drew Carter serves as the television play-by-play announcer with Brian
Scalabrine as an analyst.
All Celtics games are heard on radio through Beasley Broadcast Group's WBZ-FM (98.5, otherwise
branded as "The Sports Hub"), with play-by-play from Sean Grande and color commentary from Cedric
Maxwell, a deal in place since the 2013–14 season.[252] It is carried on stations in 5 of the 6 New England
States via the Boston Celtics Radio Network.
Long-time announcers Johnny Most and Mike Gorman have won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for their
outstanding work as broadcasters. Most was the team's radio announcer from 1953 to 1990, and Gorman
served as the television announcer from 1981 to 2024.
